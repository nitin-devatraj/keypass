# keypass

KeyPass is a demo app where one can login and logout (w/h dummy credentials). i built this app to practise few features of react like useEffect hook to store/read user login info on client side, useReducer to manage a few complex states instead of multiple state slices, Context Api with useContext hook avoid prop drilling and lastly use ForwardRef & useImperativeHandle to be able to attack a ref to a func component.
